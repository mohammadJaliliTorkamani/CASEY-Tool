The backend did not properly take into account SMB servers that have any kind of anonymous auth configured.

      "Vulnerability description:Singularity (an open source container platform) from version 3.1.1 through 3.6.3 has a vulnerability. Due to insecure handling of path traversal and the lack of path sanitization within `unsquashfs`, it is possible to overwrite/create any files on the host filesystem during the extraction with a crafted squashfs filesystem. The extraction occurs automatically for unprivileged (either installation or with `allow setuid = no`) run of Singularity when a user attempt to run an image which is a local SIF image or a single file containing a squashfs filesystem and is coming from remote sources `library://` or `shub://`. Image build is also impacted in a more serious way as it can be used by a root user, allowing an attacker to overwrite/create files leading to a system compromise, so far bootstrap methods `library`, `shub` and `localimage` are triggering the squashfs extraction. This issue is addressed in Singularity 3.6.4. All users are advised to upgrade to 3.6.4 especially if they use Singularity mainly for building image as root user. There is no solid workaround except to temporary avoid to use unprivileged mode with single file images in favor of sandbox images instead. Regarding image build, temporary avoid to build from `library` and `shub` sources and as much as possible use `--fakeroot` or a VM for that.\nVulnerable lines:\n\tfilename := \"/proc/self/fd/0\"\n-----------\n\t\targs := []string{\"-user-xattrs\", \"-f\", \"-d\", dest, filename}\n-----------\n\t\targs = append(args, files...)\n-----------\n\t\tcmd := exec.Command(s.UnsquashfsPath, args...)\n-----------\n\t\tif bytes.HasPrefix(o, []byte(\"SYNTAX\")) {\n-----------\n\targs := []string{\"-f\", \"-d\", dest, filename}\n-----------\n\targs = append(args, files...)\n-----------\n\tcmd := exec.Command(s.UnsquashfsPath, args...)"

      "Vulnerability description:In xmpp-http-upload before version 0.4.0, when the GET method is attacked, attackers can read files which have a `.data` suffix and which are accompanied by a JSON file with the `.meta` suffix. This can lead to Information Disclosure and in some shared-hosting scenarios also to circumvention of authentication or other limitations on the outbound (GET) traffic. For example, in a scenario where a single server has multiple instances of the application running (with separate DATA_ROOT settings), an attacker who has knowledge about the directory structure is able to read files from any other instance to which the process has read access. If instances have individual authentication (for example, HTTP authentication via a reverse proxy, source IP based filtering) or other restrictions (such as quotas), attackers may circumvent those limits in such a scenario by using the Directory Traversal to retrieve data from the other instances. If the associated XMPP server (or anyone knowing the SECRET_KEY) is malicious, they can write files outside the DATA_ROOT. The files which are written are constrained to have the `.meta` and the `.data` suffixes; the `.meta` file will contain the JSON with the Content-Type of the original request and the `.data` file will contain the payload.

      "Vulnerability description:In Wiki.js before version 2.5.151, directory traversal outside of Wiki.js context is possible when a storage module with local asset cache fetching is enabled. A malicious user can potentially read any file on the file system by crafting a special URL that allows for directory traversal. This is only possible when a storage module implementing local asset cache (e.g Local File System or Git) is enabled and that no web application firewall solution (e.g. cloudflare) strips potentially malicious URLs. Commit 084dcd69d1591586ee4752101e675d5f0ac6dcdc fixes this vulnerability by sanitizing the path before it is passed on to the storage module. The sanitization step removes any directory traversal (e.g. `..` and `.`) sequences as well as invalid filesystem characters from the path. As a workaround, disable any storage module with local asset caching capabilities such as Local File System and Git.\nVulnerable lines:\n    let pathParts = _.filter(_.split(rawPath, '/'), p => !_.isEmpty(p))\n-----------\n      ['dateCreated', page.createdAt],"

      "Vulnerability description:The October CMS debugbar plugin before version 3.1.0 contains a feature where it will log all requests (and all information pertaining to each request including session data) whenever it is enabled. This presents a problem if the plugin is ever enabled on a system that is open to untrusted users as the potential exists for them to use this feature to view all requests being made to the application and obtain sensitive information from those requests. There even exists the potential for account takeovers of authenticated users by non-authenticated public users, which would then lead to a number of other potential issues as an attacker could theoretically get full access to the system if the required conditions existed. Issue has been patched in v3.1.0 by locking down access to the debugbar to all users; it now requires an authenticated backend user with a specifically enabled permission before it is even usable, and the feature that allows access to stored request information is restricted behind a different permission that's more restrictive.\nVulnerable lines:\n            'name'        => 'Debugbar',\n-----------\n            'description' => 'Debugbar integration for OctoberCMS.',\n-----------\n            'icon'        => 'icon-cog',\n-----------\n        App::register('\\Barryvdh\\Debugbar\\ServiceProvider');\n-----------\n            $this->app['Illuminate\\Contracts\\Http\\Kernel']->pushMiddleware('\\RainLab\\Debugbar\\Middleware\\Debugbar');\n-----------\n        Event::listen('cms.page.beforeDisplay', function ($controller, $url, $page) {\n-----------\n            // Only show for authenticated backend users\n-----------\n            if (!BackendAuth::check()) {\n-----------\n                Debugbar::disable();\n-----------\n        } catch (\\Exception $ex) {\n-----------\n            if (!\\Request::ajax()) {\n-----------\n                ? $ex->getContents() : \\October\\Rain\\Exception\\ErrorHandler::getDetailedMessage($ex);\n-----------\n            return \\Response::make($message, $this->getStatusCode($ex), $debugbar->getDataAsHeaders());\n-----------\n        }\n-----------\n        elseif ($exception instanceof AjaxException) {\n-----------\n        }\n-----------\n        else {"
